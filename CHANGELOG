pre-history
note: If for any reason somebody is interested in an ancient DOS or MFC
versions of TONG!... first, don't be.  They were never finished and were
rather buggy even in their incomplete states.  Second, if you are
interested anyway, buy me a beer or something and I'll sniff through my
old dusty backup CDs and disks and see if any trace of them even remains.
update: They exist!  I'll upload copies somewhere.  Someday.
