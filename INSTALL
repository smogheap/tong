TONG! is written to build on any sane system that has the following:
* SDL       - http://www.libsdl.org/
* SDL_image - http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image
* SDL_mixer - http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer
Naturally you'll need a compiler too.  GCC is my personal favorite, and is
available from http://gcc.gnu.org/


BUILDING TONG
-------------

(If you're compiling on Windows (including 64-bit), see INSTALL.win32)

* First, shalt thou run 'make'.
If you're not picky where the game binary lives, then that's it!  A "tong"
executable should get built in the base tong-x.x directory.  If not, you
might need to install SDL, SDL_Image, and SDL_Mixer. (http://libsdl.org)
(Development libraries, not runtime... but I'm sure you knew that. :^)
If you've got that stuff installed and it won't build, play with Makefile
or email me (owenswerk@gmail.com) and ask for help.

You're free to move the directory to /opt/games or some such and make a
script in /usr/local/bin or something to launch it from anywhere.  If you
are a GNU/Linux user I'm making the cruel assumption that you know what
you're doing and won't have any trouble.  One thing to note is that tong
wants to be run in its own directory; i.e. the media/ folder is in its
correct relative position.
